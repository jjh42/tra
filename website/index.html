    <h1> What is Libtra</h1>
    <p>
        This is a library and utility program for a trashcan for UNIX systems.
        A trashcan is a file (usually $HOME/.trash) where files are moved to
        rather than being deleted - this allows easy recover later when some decides
        that they really shouldn't have deleted that file.
     </p>
     <p>
        To allow features like trashing a file with the same name multiple times
        or automatically cleaning the trashbin of files trashed more than a month
        ago etc. a database needs to be associated with the trash can.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a library named libtra and a utility program for using that library
        to implement a trash can on a UNIX system.
       </p>

      <h1> Installing </h1>
      <p>
            To install libtra and the utility program tra (used in examples below) download the
            <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/tra/tra-0.0.1.tar.gz?download">source tar</a>
            and follow the standard install instructions.

      </p>
       <p>
            For installing this follows the usual GNU standard.
            <p class="example">
            <br/>
            $ ./configure
            <br/>
            $ make
            <br/>
            $ su root
            <br/>
            $ make install.
            <br/>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            The utility named tra is a command line app for trashing rather than deleting
            files. The most common use is
            <p class="example">
                tra filename [filename2] ...
            </p>
            This trashs the filename (can be more than one).
        </p>
        <p>
            If you would like to list the files currently in the trashcan.
            <p class="example">
                tra -l
            </p>
            Displays a list of the trashed files and there original location.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you would like to empty the trash can.
            <p class="example">
                tra -e
            </p>
            Note: This will ask for confirmation you really want to do this.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you decide that you really did need a file trashed early
            then.
            <p class="example">
            tra -r filename
            </p>
            Restores the named file.
        </p>
