This is a library and utility program for a trashcan for UNIX systems.
A trashcan is a file (usually $HOME/.trash) where files are moved to
rather than being deleted - this allows easy recover later when some decides
that they really shouldn't have deleted that file.

To allow features like trashing a file with the same name multiple times 
or automatically cleaning the trashbin of files trashed more than a month 
ago etc. a database needs to be associated with the trash can.

This is a library named libtra and a utility program for using that library
to implement a trash can on a UNIX system. 

For using the libtra library see the api documentation.

For installing this follows the usual GNU standard.
$ ./configure
$ make
$ su root
$ make install.

The utility named tra is a command line app for trashing rather than deleting
files. The most common use is
    tra filename [filename2] ...
This trashs the filename (can be more than one).

If you would like to list the files currently in the trashcan.
    tra -l
Displays a list of the trashed files and there original location.

If you would like to empty the trash can.
    tra -e
Note: This will ask for confirmation you really want to do this.

If you decide that you really did need a file trashed early 
then.
    tra -r filename
Restores the named file.
